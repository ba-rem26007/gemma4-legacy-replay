Evidence notebook for a forum report to the organisers. Everything here is produced by the organisers' own code from the official wheelhouse (swegemma 0.2.7, adk_submission 0.2.11) with the competition's wheels/ directory and the swebench-sandbox image, network off. No model is involved: each task is graded with its reference (gold) patch and with no patch.


Kindly adress the questions in the notebook

Same. I pulled everything directly from the data tab. 


Here's everything I found, sorted:


These are definite dataset bugs, and gold patch cannot pass on py3.13


8× requests tasks — `6589, 6592, 6629, 6757, 7328, 7433, 7502, 7505`



- Python 3.13 enables `VERIFY_X509_STRICT` by default; pytest-httpbin's bundled cert has no Authority Key Identifier → every https test fails with `SSLCertVerificationError: Missing Authority Key Identifier`. Since resolution requires the whole touched test file to exit 0, these are unresolvable for everyone. (Verified: gold patches produce 315+ passed but the same 7–10 inherent SSL/timeout failures.)


3× version-gated required tests — `fastapi_14186`, `fastapi_15745`, `rich_3486`



- The `test_patch` adds tests decorated `@needs_py_lt_314` (which is `skipif(sys.version_info > (3,13))` → skips on every 3.13.x, including 3.13.0, because `(3,13,0) > (3,13)` tuple-compares True) and `skip if(minor >= 11)`. On the 3.13 runtime they can never run — only skip. If the scorer counts extracted test names as required-and must-pass, these are unresolvable; if it precomputed FAIL_TO_PASS on the same env, they're excluded and just noise.


1× Python-behavior drift — `rich_3472`



- `test_attrs_broken_310` expects `'Foo' object has no attribute 'bar'`; on 3.13 CPython emits the full `__qualname__` (`'tests.test_pretty.<locals>.Foo'`). No patch can fix a Python-version difference in the error string. Dead task.

I think there are two problems:



- Missing wheels (pytest collection fails for every fastapi task, gold patch included)


With swegemma 0.2.7, the published `sandbox/wheels/` and the image from `docker/Dockerfile.sandbox`, every fastapi task exits pytest with code 2 at collection:



```
E   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'typing_inspection'

```

Cause: the wheelhouse ships `pydantic-2.13.4`, whose METADATA declares `Requires-Dist: typing-inspection>=0.4.2` (every pydantic >= 2.11 needs it), but no `typing_inspection` wheel is included. The offline install in `container_setup.py` silently skips it, so `import fastapi -> import pydantic` fails regardless of the patch. Also absent from the wheelhouse but imported directly by the tests: `inline-snapshot` (+ `asttokens`, `executing`) – needed by 22 of the 67 public fastapi tasks; `dirty-equals` – 9 tasks; `ujson`/`orjson` – 2; `python-multipart` – 1.



- Starlette version selection


After adding those wheels locally, a gold-patch control over the 67 non-dev public fastapi tasks resolves only 13/67. The wheelhouse contains 60 starlette versions (0.19.0 … 0.52.1, 1.3.1, 1.6.0), but `container_setup._deduplicate_wheels` keeps the highest version per package and `_ensure_container_site_packages` unpacks that set into site-packages before `sandbox/setup.py` runs; `setup.py` is called with `--fast-path`, which installs nothing (its slow path also strips version constraints). So every fastapi commit runs against starlette 1.6.0. Starlette 1.0 removed `Router(on_startup=...)`, hence 48 tasks fail with:



```
TypeError: Router.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'on_startup'

```

Only commits that happen to be compatible with starlette 1.x can pass. As such, 54/67 public fastapi tasks are automatically failed with the shipped harness, gold patch or not.

I'm also facing the same, I've reproduced it using the getting started kernel. I've patched the Evaluator to bypass the model call and return the ground truth directly.
