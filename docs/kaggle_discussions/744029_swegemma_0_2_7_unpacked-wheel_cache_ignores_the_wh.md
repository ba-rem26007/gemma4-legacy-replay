If you add wheels to your local wheels directory (for example `typing_inspection`, `inline_snapshot` or `dirty_equals`, which the public `wheels/` folder lacks and which many FastAPI tests import), a local `swegemma` run may keep failing with the same `ModuleNotFoundError` as before. The cause is the cache that `swegemma` uses for unpacked wheels.


The code is in `swegemma/harness/container_setup.py`, `_build_unpacked_wheels_tar()`:



```
cache_dir = Path(tempfile.gettempdir()) / 'swegemma_sp_cache_v8'
tar_path = cache_dir / f'{cache_name}.tar'
if tar_path.exists() and tar_path.stat().st_size > 0:
    return tar_path

```

It is called with `cache_name='sp_base'` for all small wheels and `f'sp_whl_{pkg_norm}'` for each large one. Neither key depends on the wheels directory, on which wheels were selected, or on their versions. After the first run, every later run in the same `$TMPDIR` reuses the old tar, whatever `wheels_dir` you pass.


To reproduce:



- Run a gold-patch check on a FastAPI task, e.g. `fastapi_15588`, with the public `wheels/`. Collection fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'typing_inspection'`.

- Copy `wheels/` to a new folder, add `typing_inspection-0.4.4-py3-none-any.whl`, and rerun with `wheels_dir` pointing to the new folder. Same error.

- `rm -rf "$TMPDIR/swegemma_sp_cache_v8"` and rerun. The gold patch passes (24 tests) and the empty patch now fails for the right reason (exit 1 instead of a collection error).


Workaround: clear `$TMPDIR/swegemma_sp_cache_v8` whenever you change the wheel set, or run each wheel set with its own `TMPDIR`. A fix on the harness side could put a digest of the selected wheel file names and sizes into `cache_name`, e.g. `sp_base_<sha1>`.
