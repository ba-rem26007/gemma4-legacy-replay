I am trying to make sure local validation reflects the code that the agent actually edits. In the published swegemma 0.2.7 wheel, install_editable_package() returns early for SubprocessManager/SubprocessSandbox. The subprocess environment sets PYTHONPATH to /workspace, while Requests task snapshots place the package under /workspace/src/requests. The official getting-started notebook uses sandbox='subprocess' for its sample evaluation.


On the public task requests_7315, I ran the unmodified verify_task test and a separate diagnostic test process in the same sandbox. Both failed the same assertion. The diagnostic process imported the system Requests package rather than /workspace/src/requests; with PYTHONPATH=src, a minimal probe imported the edited workspace code. This observation is from a local Kaggle CPU evaluation, not a claim about the hidden final scoring environment.


Could the organizers clarify: (1) which sandbox/backend final patch validation uses; (2) how src-layout packages are made importable from the patched workspace; and (3) whether participants should take any supported action, or whether final scoring handles this? I want to avoid optimizing an agent against a local validation path that may not match final scoring.
