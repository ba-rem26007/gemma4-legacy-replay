Hi @ryanholbrook , One data issue: in the current embeddings, random node pairs have mean cosine similarity 0.78 (fastapi) to 0.90 (rich), and 8–19% of random pairs are ≥ 0.99. Querying the exact name of a task's gold function returns unrelated test functions, all at similarity 1.0. Across 129 training tasks, the gold file appears in the top 10 for 35 tasks, versus 67 for a plain grep on the issue's identifiers.



- Is this expected (e.g., a model that embeds mostly boilerplate), or could the embedding step be regenerated?

- Does the hidden test set use the same embeddings pipeline?

- search_similar_code only accepts an existing node name. Is a text query encoder planned, or is node-name lookup the intended use?

Independent check on our side, consistent with yours: on fastapi_14246 the node embeddings give a mean random-pair cosine of 0.78 (7% of pairs >= 0.99; 2,635 distinct vectors among 3,619 nodes), and on rich_3905 0.90 (11% >= 0.99).


A related coverage issue in the graphs themselves (one commit per repo checked): every edge has type `calls`, and no `async def` function appears as a node: 0 of 57 async functions in fastapi's package (e.g. routing.run_endpoint_function, routing.serialize_response, dependencies.utils.solve_dependencies) and 0 of 100 in httpx's async client (src/ahttpx). rich and requests have no async code, so they are unaffected.


@ryanholbrook: does the hidden test set use the same graph/embedding pipeline, and could async functions (and ideally import/containment edges) be included? Also, which embedding model produced the 256-d vectors?
