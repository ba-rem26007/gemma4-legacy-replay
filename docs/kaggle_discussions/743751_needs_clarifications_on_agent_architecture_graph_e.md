A.Agent architecture
1)can a custom skill carry substantial precomputed repository metadata?(what it should not carry list can be pretty useful)
2)how many LLM sub-agents can be invoked?
3)are sub-agent calls counted against the same global task time?
4)re parallel sub-agents actually useful given sequential task execution?
5)is there a limit on nested agent depth?
6)are custom tools limited to deterministic code?
B.Graph/embedding resources
1)Is the graph built from AST only or AST + semantic dependencies or how in which basis?
2)what exactly does embedding similarity represent?
3)are embeddings indexed per snapshot/commit?
4)are the zero-byte graph files a known release bug?
5)will corrected graph files be released?how soon?
6)will corrected embedding files be released?how soon?
7)are async functions intentionally missing or a preprocessing bug?
