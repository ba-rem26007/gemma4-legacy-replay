Observing the current LB distribution:



```
0.00, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10, 0.12, 0.13

```

and since Kaggle has always rounded down LB scores, there is only one test set size that could lead to exactly this distribution



```
# Displayed scores expressed in hundredths.
observed = {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13}

def compatible(n):
    possible = {100 * k // n for k in range(n + 1)}
    return observed <= possible

print([n for n in range(1, 79) if compatible(n)])
# [58]

```

which is close to the ~60 described in the data description



  There are about 120 tasks in the test set, evenly divided between the public and private splits.
