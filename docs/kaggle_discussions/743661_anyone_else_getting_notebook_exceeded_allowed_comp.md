Hey everyone 👋


I ran my first submission today and after roughly 2–2.5 hours of evaluation, it failed with:



  Notebook Exceeded Allowed Compute
  "Your notebook has requested more CPU, GPU or TPU resources than are available."

I understand that this is a general compute/constraint error, but I'm trying to understand what specifically might have triggered it in this competition.


My submission.zip was structured as an Agent Config and used:



- Model: gemma-4-31b-it-qat-w4a16-ct

- LoRA adapters: None

- Thinking: include_thoughts: false

- Architecture: Root agent.yaml + one code_analyzer sub-agent via agent_tool

- Sub-agent model: gemma-4-31b-it-qat-w4a16-ct


Per-task budget:


```yaml
timeout_seconds: 300
max_tool_calls: 35
max_time_minutes: 12
max_turns: 30
Has anyone else encountered this error with a submission containing an agent_tool sub-agent?

Yes, I got this too despite testing on Kaggle GPU first last night after a few hours.
