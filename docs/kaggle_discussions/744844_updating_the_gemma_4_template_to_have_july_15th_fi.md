The competition model (gemma-4-31b-it-qat-w4a16-ct, version 2, files dated 2026-06-05) ships the
original chat_template.jinja. On 2026-07-15, Google replaced it in the same HF repo (google/gemma-4-31B-it-qat-w4a16-ct, commit 88c0905) with the canonical Gemma 4 template.
Google reports better tool-calling reliability with the refresh.


Submissions can't change the template: the harness starts vLLM without --chat-template and the generation config has no template field. Loops and malformed tool calls are a large share of failures for every agent here, so this would help all teams equally.


Would the organizers consider serving the updated template (or passing --chat-template) for scoring?


Weights are unchanged; it is a single-file swap.

The July canonical template still has a turn-boundary bug for OpenAI-format messages where the assistant returns visible text together with tool calls.


I reproduced this with commit `88c090599fb794134cba57e022082043afcc7bf8`, using `add_generation_prompt=True` and `enable_thinking=False`. No model inference is needed.


Minimal reproduction:



```
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tok = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    "google/gemma-4-31B-it-qat-w4a16-ct",
    revision="88c090599fb794134cba57e022082043afcc7bf8",
)

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Read x.py."},
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "NOTE_BEFORE_CALL",
        "tool_calls": [{
            "id": "c1",
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "read_file",
                "arguments": {"filepath": "x.py"},
            },
        }],
    },
    {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "c1", "content": "RESULT"},
]

text = tok.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    enable_thinking=False,
)
print(repr(text[-200:]))

```

The prompt ends with:



```
...RESULT<|"|>}<tool_response|>NOTE_BEFORE_CALL<turn|>\n

```

The model turn has been closed, but no new `<|turn>model` header is added. Setting the assistant’s content to `None` instead leaves the turn open at `<tool_response|>`.


The cause appears to be:



- The template renders tool calls, then tool responses, then assistant content.

- Nonempty content triggers `<turn|>`.

- `ns.prev_message_type` remains `tool_response`, so the generation-prompt branch suppresses the new model header.


The updated `continues_into_next` check fixes historical boundaries when another assistant message is already present. At the end of a generation prompt, that next assistant message does not exist yet, so this case remains broken.


There is also a chronology issue: OpenAI assistant content accompanying tool calls can be a note emitted before execution, but the template moves it after the tool result.


Could this case be checked alongside the proposed template update? A swap to the July canonical version alone does not resolve this final boundary. This is a reproducible formatting issue; I have not measured its effect on task scores.

Some errors are still expected with a 31B model, but at least an update will resolve the bigger ones that are already readily fixed.
