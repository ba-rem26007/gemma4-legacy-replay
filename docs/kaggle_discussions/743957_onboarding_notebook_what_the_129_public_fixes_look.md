I put together an onboarding notebook for anyone starting out: https://www.kaggle.com/code/osama133/gemma-4-dev-agent-task-anatomy-survival-kit


Task anatomy: 57% of the public tasks are single-file fixes of 20 lines or fewer; in ~76% the issue names neither the file nor the function to change; about 1 in 6 fixes touch async code; and issue length does not predict fix size.


What it means: research framing (SWE-bench, SWE-agent, Agentless, IR-based bug localisation) and design alternatives for localise / repair / validate / budget.


Survival kit: finding where inputs are mounted, getting files out of an interactive GPU session, delivering submission.zip from a CPU notebook, and GPU queue notes.


Runs on CPU in under a minute. Feedback welcome!
