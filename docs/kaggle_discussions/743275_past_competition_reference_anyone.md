Hi I am new to this Agentic-AI world and still going through its early phase of learning. Can anyone know Past competitions similar to this one so I can take reference from it. 


Thanks in advance.!!

Hi! Welcome to the exciting field of Agentic-AI and Autonomous Software Engineering!
The Google - The Gemma 4 Developer Agent Competition is actually a landmark event because it is the first official Kaggle competition that evaluates full-lifecycle coding agents on real-world SWE-bench benchmarks in an air-gapped container environment using local quantized models.
Here are the most relevant historical benchmarks, research open-source projects, and papers with direct links to help you get started:

### 1. Direct Benchmarks & Prior Art


SWE-bench / SWE-bench Verified: The gold standard benchmark created by Princeton & Stanford that this competition is built upon. Check their official leaderboard and paper:
- Website: swebench.com

- GitHub: princeton-nlp/SWE-bench

- Paper: "SWE-bench: Can Language Models Resolve Real-World GitHub Issues?" (arXiv:2310.06770)

SWE-agent (Princeton NLP): One of the pioneering autonomous agents running inside Docker containers with a specialized Agent-Computer Interface (ACI).
- GitHub: princeton-nlp/SWE-agent

Agentless (UIUC): A brilliant open-source project by Prof. Lingming Zhang's group that challenges complex multi-turn agent loops. It uses a clean 2-phase approach (Localization -> Repair) and achieves competitive solve rates at a fraction of the cost.
- GitHub: OpenAutoCoder/Agentless

- Paper: "Agentless: Demystifying LLM-based Software Engineering Agents" (arXiv:2407.01489)



### 2. Similar Competitive Environments on Kaggle


- Kaggle AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO): Great reference for tool-augmented multi-step reasoning under strict memory and hardware timeouts.

- Kaggle LLM Science Exam: Excellent reference for handling air-gapped inference and packaging custom libraries without internet access.



### 3. Vital Tips for Beginners (To Avoid Burning Your Evaluation Quota)

Since Kaggle enforces strict runtime budgets (e.g., total 12-hour limit across all tasks, 4GB RAM/2 vCPUs per container), here are a few golden rules:



- Token Economy is King: Avoid letting the model output massive thinking blocks or full-file rewrites. The context window can easily saturate. Keeping generation lean and focused directly saves you from Out-Of-Memory (OOM) or token limit errors.

- Micro-Surgical Edits Over Refactoring: In real software bugs, over 70% of fixes require fewer than 15 lines of code (e.g., adding a None check, stripping whitespace, or fixing parameter types). Avoid having the agent refactor surrounding code, as it almost always breaks pre-existing unit tests.

Fail-Fast Strategy: Don't let your agent burn 30 minutes on a single broken or unsolvable issue. Set a tight timeout/turn cap so it moves on quickly to solvable tasks.

Best of luck on your competition journey! 🚀

You may also want to check out the Nemotron Reasoning Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nvidia-nemotron-model-reasoning-challenge). Kinda similar in that you're adding a LoRA adapter to an existing model, albeit with a different target.
