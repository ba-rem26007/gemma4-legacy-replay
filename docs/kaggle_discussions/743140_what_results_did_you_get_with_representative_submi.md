I submitted the sample_submission given in the competition data to the leaderboard today, it gave a score of 0.01

Are the results deterministic -  I see `"temperature": 0.2` which could have some variation.  Not sure what else could cause non deterministic results

Since this competition allows only one submission per day, I’d like to leverage the community to compare results.


I’ll share a couple of examples from my side as well.



### Gemma 4 SWE Agent: Complete EDA & ADK Starter Kit

https://www.kaggle.com/code/nursrijan/gemma-4-swe-agent-complete-eda-adk-starter-kit


I submitted the output as-is and got LB = 0.05.



### GEMMA: EDA, Baseline for a start | LB TOP 1

https://www.kaggle.com/code/romanrozen/gemma-eda-baseline-for-a-start-lb-top-1


This notebook currently shows LB = 0.12, which appears to be the best score among the publicly available notebooks.


If anyone has submitted this notebook, what result did you get? Did you get the same score of 0.12?


Also, in the organizers' discussion titled "Welcome to the Gemma 4 Developer Agent Competition," they mention that:



  we’ve provided a starter submission



What score did this starter submission achieve on the leaderboard?


That's all from me. Please share your results in the comments! It would be great to compare everyone's findings.

Answering your last question: the official `sample_submission`, submitted byte-for-byte as-is (submission `56539111`, 2026-09-25 03:46 UTC) → FAILED, no score. Only message: `Your notebook hit an unhandled error while rerunning your code.`


It still contains both `adapters/main_lora` and `adapters/tool_lora`, so my current suspicion is the adapter path. What I mean by that: `adapter: <name>` never goes through local PEFT loading — in `swegemma/models/registry.py` (`resolve_swegemma_adapter`, and `_make_adapter_model` inside `setup_gemma_model_registry`) it rewrites the agent's model into a LiteLLM id of `openai/<adapter-name>`, i.e. the run asks the inference endpoint to serve a LoRA already registered under that name (vLLM `--lora-modules <name>=<path>`). For this package the compiled root agent's model string is literally `openai/main_lora`, and `swegemma` itself never starts the server, so that registration lives entirely on the scoring side. I verified locally with the pinned wheels (`google-adk 1.36.1`, `adk-submission 0.2.11`, `swegemma 0.2.7`) that the package compiles clean, that `discover_adapters()` returns both names, and that all 9 tools register unconditionally — so it is not a YAML/assembly bug and not the empty graph/embedding files. This is a hypothesis about the failure, not a confirmed diagnosis.


Worth adding, because it changes how useful your two numbers are: I read the packaging cells of both notebooks — `nursrijan`'s starter-kit bundle writes `configs/ prompts/ sub_agents/ agent.yaml`, and `romanrozen`'s bundle likewise contains no `adapters/` (LoRA appears there only in a validator check and in a roadmap line saying "LoRA adapter, if the rules allow"). So neither the 0.05 nor the 0.12 exercises the adapter path, and as far as I can tell no public submission has. That is consistent with the failure above being LoRA-related rather than a bug in my packaging.


Next step: same official package with `adapters/` and the two `adapter:` lines removed, nothing else touched. If it scores, the adapter path is the trigger; if it fails the same way, it isn't. I'll report whichever happens.
