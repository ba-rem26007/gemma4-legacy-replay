# lora_gemma4-e4b-prestashop

QLoRA adapter for **Gemma 4 E4B** (`google/gemma-4-E4B-it`) trained to follow a fixed bug-fixing flow on PrestaShop (PHP):
localise (keywords) → read (files) → edit (SEARCH/REPLACE blocks). Part of the Kaggle *Gemma 4 Developer Agent* Paper Track
submission — paper and code: https://github.com/ba-rem26007/gemma4-legacy-replay (`docs/KAGGLE_FINAL_WRITEUP.md`).

## Training data

585 prepared examples, all from PrestaShop bugs merged **before 2025-06-01** (Gemma 4's declared cutoff is January 2025):
- 569 paths reconstructed deterministically from official upstream fixes (`trajectories/reconstruct.py`);
- 16 paths produced by Gemma 4 31B itself and verified by execution (`trajectories/self_paths.py`).

Examples touching any function also fixed after the split were excluded. No proprietary-model output is included.
With `MAX_LEN = 2048`, **89 examples** were actually used. Exact snapshot: `training/snapshots/trajectories_v15.tar.gz`.

## Training

4-bit QLoRA, r = 16, α = 32, 3 epochs (18 steps), lr 5e-5, 2× T4 on Kaggle, 7,209 s, mean training loss 1.192
(`training/snapshots/train_kaggle_v15.py`, log `training/lora_final/gemma-4-qlora-training-prestashop.log`).
A chunked cross-entropy (`training/chunked_loss.py`) avoids materialising the full logits tensor over the 262k vocabulary.
`adapter_model.safetensors` sha256 starts with `fac3f1af8b0fb855`.

## Evaluation (33 hidden-oracle TEST bugs, PrestaShop 9.1.x, merged after the split)

| System | Solved | Right file read | Regressions |
|---|---|---|---|
| E · Gemma 4 E4B + this adapter + rules/glossary/replay spec, 2 retries | 4/33 (12.1%) | 42.4% | 1 |
| A · Gemma 4 26B A4B, ticket only (for reference) | 5/33 | 63.6% | 0 |
| A · Gemma 4 31B, ticket only (mean of 4 runs) | 12.8/33 (38.6%) | — | 0 |

This is a **system-vs-system** comparison, not an isolated LoRA ablation (no base-E4B run with the same setup exists).
The adapter mainly teaches the output format; it does not make E4B competitive with 31B on this benchmark.

## Limitations

Small training set (89 examples), n = 33 test bugs, single run for E. PrestaShop is © PrestaShop SA and contributors (OSL-3.0).
